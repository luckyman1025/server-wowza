other systems designated by Wowza to assist Wowza in validating
your Software license; you shall permit the Software to do so.
Information that may be collected by Wowza for this purpose shall

discretion.

     5.1.2  Unless you have an Offline License Key, in the event the
Software fails to periodically call into and connect with the hardware,
software, or other systems designated by Wowza, Wowza shall have
the right to terminate your license to use the Software without further
notice to you three (3) days following of the last date of successful
contact of the Software with the Wowza hardware, software, or
designated system.

restrictions, limitations, or specifications.

     5.2.2  Regardless of the type of Software license or License Key

hardware, software, or other systems designated by Wowza, and
Wowza may collect, maintain, process, and use diagnostic, technical,
usage, and related information, including but not limited to information
about your computer, system, application software, and peripherals,
along with information about usage of the foregoing.  Such
information may also be collected in connection with Wowza's
provision of the Services.  Wowza may use such information to
facilitate the provision of Software updates and support, verify your
compliance with this EULA, improve Wowza's products and services,
or for any other purpose in its sole discretion.

   5.3  License Keys, Generally.  You agree to not take any
action that is intended or likely to defeat, weaken, or threaten any
security or License Key integrity measures employed by Wowza,
including without limitation, measures intended to prevent duplicate,
pirated, or similar unauthorized License Keys or use of the Software.
You agree that you are solely and completely responsible for License
Key abuse related to an Offline License Key issued to you.

  6.  MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT.  Wowza offers the
Services during applicable Services Periods on a per-License Key
basis.  Additional terms and conditions regarding the Services may
be posted on the Wowza Website or communicated to you by Wowza
from time to time.

   6.1  Services Provided Per-License Key.  The Services are
provided on a per-License Key basis, and not on a per-customer or
per-company basis.  Each License Key has an individual Services
Period that begins on the date you obtained such License Key from
Wowza or purchased an additional Services Period for such License
Key from Wowza.  You agree to only access or obtain the benefit of
the Services for the specific License Key(s) provided to Wowza when
requesting such Services and you agree to not use the Services,
including Updates and Upgrades, for the benefit of any License Key
not then entitled to the Services.

   6.2  Services Periods.  Services are only provided during the
Services Period.  Services Periods vary by license type.  License
types are more fully described in Section 4, above.

     6.2.1  The Services Period for Trial, Developer, Testing, and
Developer Program license type License Keys begin on the date you
obtain the corresponding License Key from Wowza and end at the
expiration of such license and License Key.

     6.2.2  The Services Period for R&D license type License Keys is
the Services Period of your perpetual or subscription license type
License Key.

     6.2.3  The Services Period for subscription license type License
Keys is the term of such subscription license for the Software.

     6.2.4  The initial Services Period for perpetual license type
License Keys is either one (1) or three (3) years from the date you
obtained a Wowza Streaming Engine Perpetual Edition License Key
from Wowza, as specified in your purchasing documents. In order to
obtain the Services beyond the initial Services Period, you must
purchase additional Services Period(s) from Wowza.  In the event of
any ambiguity, the Services Period for all perpetual type License
Keys shall be deemed to be one (1) year from the date you obtained
a Wowza Streaming Engine Perpetual Edition License Key from
Wowza.

     6.2.5  If you obtained your Software, License Key, or both from
a party other than Wowza (such as a Wowza authorized reseller or
OEM partner), your Services Period may differ from those described
herein.

   6.3  The Services.  Subject to the terms of this EULA and
other terms and conditions on the Wowza Website and provided to
you from time to time, Wowza will provide the Services to you during
the Services Period for each individual License Key.

     6.3.1  Wowza will not provide Services related to: (i) prior
versions of the Software; (ii) improper installation or use of the
Software; (iii) software or other products or services not offered,
licensed, and provided to you by Wowza, and the implementation or
use of the Software with any of the foregoing; (iv) modified code; (v)
other things not specifically described herein as within the scope of
the Services.

     6.3.2  In the event a Services Period expires for a given License
Key and you elect to not purchase additional Services Periods but
later wish to receive Services from Wowza related to such License
Key, Wowza may, in its sole discretion, require you to purchase
Services Periods retroactively to the date on which the relevant
Services Period previously lapsed, pay a reinstatement fee, or both.

     6.3.3  Wowza may suspend or terminate the Services without
owing a refund to you if your use of the Services is determined by
Wowza, in its sole and reasonable discretion, to be excessive or
improper.

     6.3.4  The Services will be provided within the timeframes
described on the Wowza Website or in other documentation provided
by Wowza.  No failure to meet a timeframe to provide Services shall
be deemed a breach of this EULA or any obligation of Wowza.
